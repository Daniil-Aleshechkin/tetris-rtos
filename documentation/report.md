# LED Matrices

# Project Description

This project involved the creation of drivers for LED matrices, as well as exploring applications for these drivers. Two drivers were created, one for a 8x8 powered by neopixel LEDs (WS-2812), and another 32x32 one from sparkfun COM-14646. The two things I did were I apply these drivers as a GUI for my 452 Tetris project, and I created a video player which plays the music video 'Bad apple' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8)

# Project Design

## WS-2812 driver
This was based on the design from the STM32F103fastNP library (https://github.com/evilwombat/stm32f103_fastNP) which uses the technique from this block post  https://www.martinhubacek.cz/blog/stm32-ws2812b-dma-library/

The data just needs to be sent with one serial connection on one pin using a specific protocal which
